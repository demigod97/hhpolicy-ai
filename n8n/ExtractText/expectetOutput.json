Please ensure that the policy you are relying on is the latest version.\nHUMAN HABITATS\nCRITICAL PERIODS ATTENDANCE\nExecutive Policy\nDecember 2024\nPolicy Summary\nPolicy Name: Critical Periods Attendance\nAttributable to: Executives\nAdmin Days happen during the year. The most important Admin Days currently are happening at the end of\nJune and December.\nThis is an important day for all the Human Habitats team as we ensure we have finalised all work to set us up\nfor the next financial year (EOFY & Admin Day) or so we can close for Christmas without any task incomplete.\nChristmas Admin Day is the most important day to get right. It finalises all projects, invoicing, WIP, Operations\ntasks and anything else to allow all staff to leave the office knowing that there is nothing else they need to do\nother than enjoy their time off for the summer.\nEOFY and Christmas Admin Days\nAll staff must be in the office for these Admin Days to ensure all tasks are complete and invoices are approved.\nWe also put a strong emphasis on staff attending the events in the evening of these days.\nNo staff may take this day off as leave except in extenuating circumstances and with the approval of the CEO\nor CPO.\nMini Admin Days (March & September Quarters)\nAll staff should be in the office for Admin to ensure all tasks are complete and invoices are drafted. If a staff\nmember is approved to take leave for this day, they must ensure they have all tasks allocated to them\ncomplete, their timesheets finalised, and all invoices for their jobs drafted.\nDecember\nWe put a strong emphasis on staff not taking extended leave the two weeks before an Admin Day due to\nproject requirements and the need for staff availability and significant get togethers. We start the week\ntogether we finish the week together we finish the quarter together."
