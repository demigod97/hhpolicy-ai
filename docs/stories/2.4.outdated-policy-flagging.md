# Story 2.4: Outdated Policy Flagging - Brownfield Addition

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** User (Admin or Executive),
**I want** the system to clearly flag when a policy document is older than 18 months,
**So that** I am immediately aware of its potential obsolescence.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing dashboard components, chat interface, date metadata from Story 2.3
- Technology: React components, date calculation utilities, existing badge/indicator patterns
- Follows pattern: Existing visual indicator and warning message patterns
- Touch points: Document cards → Age calculation → Visual flagging + Chat responses → Age disclaimers

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. In the dashboard/document list, a clear visual indicator (e.g., a warning icon) is displayed next to any document whose extracted date is more than 18 months in the past
2. When the chat AI provides an answer sourced from a document older than 18 months, its response **must** include a disclaimer (e.g., "Note: This information is from a policy that is over 18 months old.")
3. Documents with no extracted date are not flagged (treated as current)

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing dashboard and document display components continue to work unchanged
5. New age flagging follows existing visual indicator patterns (badges, icons)
6. Integration with chat responses maintains existing citation format with added disclaimers

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Age calculations are accurate and handle edge cases (leap years, timezone differences)
8. Visual indicators are accessible and follow WCAG AA guidelines
9. Performance impact from date calculations is negligible

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Add age calculation utilities, extend existing document cards with warning indicators, enhance chat response formatting
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow existing badge and warning indicator patterns from current UI components
- **Key Constraints:** Must handle documents with null/missing dates gracefully, ensure accurate 18-month calculations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Incorrect date calculations could flag current documents as outdated
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive date calculation testing, graceful handling of edge cases
- **Rollback:** Disable age flagging, remove warning indicators and disclaimers

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes leverage existing date metadata fields
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Age Calculation Utilities**
  - [ ] Create robust date calculation utility for 18-month threshold
  - [ ] Handle various date formats and edge cases
  - [ ] Add timezone-aware date comparisons
  - [ ] Implement comprehensive date validation

- [ ] **Task 2: Dashboard Visual Indicators**
  - [ ] Add warning icons to document cards for outdated policies
  - [ ] Implement consistent visual design for age warnings
  - [ ] Add tooltips explaining the 18-month threshold
  - [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance for warning indicators

- [ ] **Task 3: Chat Response Disclaimers**
  - [ ] Extend chat response formatting to include age disclaimers
  - [ ] Add clear warning messages for outdated policy citations
  - [ ] Implement conditional disclaimer logic based on source document age
  - [ ] Ensure disclaimers are prominently displayed

- [ ] **Task 4: Testing & Edge Case Handling**
  - [ ] Test date calculations across various scenarios
  - [ ] Validate handling of documents with missing dates
  - [ ] Test visual indicators across different screen sizes
  - [ ] Verify disclaimer accuracy in chat responses

## Dev Notes

### Age Calculation Logic
- Threshold: 18 months from document's extracted effective/last updated date
- Calculation: document_date < (current_date - 18 months)
- Null dates: Not flagged (assume current)

### Visual Design Requirements
- Warning icon: Amber/orange warning triangle
- Placement: Next to document title in cards/lists
- Tooltip: "This policy is over 18 months old and may be outdated"
- Accessible: Proper ARIA labels and color contrast

### Chat Disclaimer Format
- Standard: "Note: This information is from a policy that is over 18 months old and may be outdated."
- Placement: At the end of responses containing outdated sources
- Styling: Clearly differentiated from main response content

### Key Files to Create/Modify
- `src/lib/dateUtils.ts` - Age calculation utilities
- `src/components/policy-document/OutdatedWarningBadge.tsx` - Warning indicator component
- `src/components/chat/ChatResponseWithDisclaimers.tsx` - Enhanced chat response
- `src/hooks/usePolicyDocumentAge.tsx` - Age calculation hook

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Date calculation accuracy, edge cases
- **Integration Tests**: Visual indicator display, chat disclaimer inclusion
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance for warning indicators
- **E2E Tests**: Complete outdated policy flagging workflow

### Edge Cases to Handle
- Documents with future dates (treat as current)
- Leap year calculations
- Different date formats in extracted metadata
- Timezone differences between server and client
- Performance with large numbers of documents
