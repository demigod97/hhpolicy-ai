# Story 1.3: Administrator Document Upload

## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** Administrator,
**I want** to upload a policy document,

1. The UI provides an interface for selecting and uploading a file (e.g., PDF, TXT).
2. The uploaded file is successfully stored in Supabase Storage.
3. A new record is created in the `policy_documents` table, linked to the Administrator's user ID.
4. The document's initial processing status is set to 'processing'.

## Dev Notes

### File Upload Requirements
- **Supported Formats**: PDF, TXT files
- **File Size Limits**: Reasonable limits to prevent abuse
- **Storage Location**: Supabase Storage with organized folder structure
- **Security**: Files should be private to the uploading user initially

### UI/UX Considerations
- **Drag and Drop**: Modern file upload experience
- **Progress Feedback**: Show upload progress to user
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for failed uploads
- **File Validation**: Client-side validation before upload

### Database Integration
- **Table**: `policy_documents` (created in Story 1.2)
- **Required Fields**: user_id, title, role_assignment, processing_status
- **Status Flow**: 'processing' → 'completed' (handled in Story 1.4)

### Key Files to Create/Modify
- `src/components/policy-document/FileUpload.tsx` - New upload component
- `src/hooks/useFileUpload.tsx` - Upload logic hook
- `src/services/documentService.ts` - Document management service
- `supabase/functions/upload-document.ts` - Server-side upload function
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Add upload functionality to dashboard

### Storage Structure
```
policy-documents/
  {user_id}/
    {document_id}/
      original.{ext}
      metadata.json
```

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Test upload component and validation logic
- **Integration Tests**: Test file upload to Supabase Storage
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete upload flow from UI to database
- **Error Tests**: Test various failure scenarios
