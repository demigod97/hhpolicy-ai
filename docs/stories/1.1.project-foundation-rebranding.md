# Story 1.1: Project Foundation & Rebranding

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Project Admin,
**I want** the initial "PolicyAi" project scaffolded from the existing codebase, with all user-facing branding updated,
**so that** development can begin on a clean, correctly-named foundation.
