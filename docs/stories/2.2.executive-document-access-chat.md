# Story 2.2: Executive Document Access & Chat - Brownfield Addition

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As an** Executive,
**I want** to log in and interact with the policy documents assigned to my role,
**So that** I can get answers to my specific questions.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing authentication system, role-based dashboard, chat interface from Story 1.5
- Technology: Supabase Auth with role context, React Query for data fetching, existing chat components
- Follows pattern: Existing user experience patterns with role-specific filtering
- Touch points: Login → Role detection → Dashboard filtering → Chat filtering → Executive-only results

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. A user with the 'Executive' role can successfully log in using existing authentication
2. Their dashboard displays *only* the policy documents that have been assigned to the 'Executive' role
3. Their chat queries return answers derived *only* from the 'Executive' policy set
4. An Executive cannot see or query any documents assigned to the 'Administrator' role

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Existing authentication and dashboard components work unchanged for Executive users
6. New Executive experience follows existing UI patterns and design system
7. Integration with role-based RLS policies maintains strict data segregation

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Executive user experience is identical in quality to Administrator experience
9. Role-based filtering is thoroughly tested to prevent data leakage
10. Performance remains within NFR3 requirements for Executive queries

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Leverage existing dashboard and chat components with role-aware data filtering
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Mirror Administrator experience (Stories 1.3-1.5) with Executive role context
- **Key Constraints:** Absolute data segregation - zero visibility into Administrator documents

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Executive users might see Administrator documents due to filtering errors
- **Mitigation:** Multi-layer role filtering (UI, API, RLS), comprehensive testing
- **Rollback:** Disable Executive access, require Administrator role for all users

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes leverage existing role_assignment field
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Executive Dashboard Experience**
  - [ ] Ensure existing dashboard components work with Executive role
  - [ ] Implement role-based document filtering in NotebookGrid
  - [ ] Add Executive-specific empty state messaging
  - [ ] Test document visibility restrictions

- [ ] **Task 2: Executive Chat Interface**
  - [ ] Extend existing chat components for Executive role context
  - [ ] Implement Executive-only document filtering in chat workflow
  - [ ] Ensure citations only reference Executive-accessible documents
  - [ ] Add Executive-specific "no results" messaging

- [ ] **Task 3: Role-Based Security Validation**
  - [ ] Verify complete data segregation between roles
  - [ ] Test Executive cannot access Administrator documents via any method
  - [ ] Validate RLS policies correctly enforce Executive-only access
  - [ ] Add comprehensive security test suite

- [ ] **Task 4: User Experience Consistency**
  - [ ] Ensure Executive experience matches Administrator UX quality
  - [ ] Implement consistent visual design across both roles
  - [ ] Add role-specific help documentation
  - [ ] Test responsive design for Executive users

## Dev Notes

### Executive User Flow
- Login → Role detected as 'executive' → Dashboard shows only documents WHERE role_assignment = 'executive' → Chat searches only Executive documents

### Data Filtering Strategy
- Frontend: User role context passed to all data queries
- Backend: N8N workflows filter by role_assignment field
- Database: RLS policies provide final security layer

### Component Reuse
- Existing components work with role-aware data fetching
- No new UI components needed - leverage existing patterns
- Role context passed through existing hook patterns

### Key Files to Create/Modify
- `src/hooks/useNotebooks.tsx` - Add Executive role filtering
- `src/hooks/usePolicyChat.tsx` - Extend for Executive role context
- `src/components/dashboard/EmptyDashboard.tsx` - Executive-specific messaging
- RLS policies verification and testing

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Role filtering logic for Executive context
- **Integration Tests**: Complete Executive user journey
- **Security Tests**: Comprehensive data segregation validation
- **E2E Tests**: Executive login → dashboard → chat workflow

### Security Validation Checklist
- [ ] Executive cannot see Administrator documents in dashboard
- [ ] Executive chat returns only Executive-document-based answers
- [ ] Direct API calls with Executive context are properly filtered
- [ ] URL manipulation cannot expose Administrator documents
- [ ] Database queries respect role_assignment boundaries
