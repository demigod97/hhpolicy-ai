# HH Policy - Returned Employee Entitlements - Exec - 20241120.pdf

## RETURNED EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENT

Executive Policy<br>November 2024

Policy Summary
Policy Name: $\quad$ Returned Employee Entitlement Policy

Attributable to: All Returned Staff

This Policy is to honour former entitlements for returning employees. We want to train our team to be great consultants, and we want our team to stay together for their entire corporate life albeit knowing people often need to move away for different reasons.

Human Habitats recognise that people may need to leave our team to further their career, experience the journey of a lifetime or have pressing family needs that take them away from their work family.

If we are not able to facilitate a continued HH connection through remote work, we will always welcome back good people where there is still a job available within the team. We encourage our team to experience the wider world and education opportunities, and we want to have our team members come back.

When employees return, we want them to reclaim the entitlements that they had accumulated prior to leaving.

## Eligibility

All employees who have returned to HH in a permanent role from a period away from HH employment where entitlements would otherwise be lost ${ }^{1}$ under federal or state law.

This policy applies to all employees who:

- Were previously employed by the Company;
- Whose employment previously terminated for any reason other than serious misconduct; and
- Who have re-commenced employment with Human Habitats.


## Reinstated Entitlements

On re-employment, this policy will restore a Staff member's former employment related entitlements back to the level they were immediately prior to termination of their employment. This could include some or all of the following:

- Paid personal/carer's leaveÂ²;
- Accrued service in respect of long service leave (LSL) ${ }^{3}$; and
- Any service triggers/hurdles (example Parental Leave Entitlement Triggers).

Annual Leave is paid out on exit and so will not be recredited.

## Executive Notes:

${ }^{1}$ Inclusive of casuals.
${ }^{2}$ This would include Family Leave
${ }^{3}$ LSL will most likely have been paid out on their previous resignation (if qualifying) for their Full LSL Entitlement (note that LSL varies State by State). If paid out, LSL should continue to accrue from zero but payroll should take into account years of service.
