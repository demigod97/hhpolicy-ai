# HH Policy - Flexi Work Policy - Admin - 20250603.pdf

## FLEXI WORK POLICY

## Administrative Policy

June 2025

## Policy Summary

Policy Name:
Flexible Work Policy
Attributable to:
All Staff members post Probation Period
Balancing our commitment to our work, colleagues, and clients with providing flexibility is a key benefit to the HH culture. This policy outlines the guidelines for around our Flexible Working Policy.

## Eligibility

All employees (includes full-time, part-time and casual employees) who commence employment with Human Habitats can access flexible working if their performance is satisfactory to utilising Flexible Work at their 3-month review meeting (see Probation Policy).

## Compliance

Once employees pass Probation and their Performance Manager agrees their performance allows for Flexible Work, compliance for flexible working must be achieved in the way of:

- Performance Manager agrees the employee can access this benefit;
- Workstation is set up to the same standard as in the office;
- Work Health and Safety check completed online to confirm the household is fit for work;
- Flex schedule is understood by the employee and there is a commitment to follow it;
- Employees only work from their approved WFH location which meets compliance;
- Employees are accessible on phone and teams during business hours and in nominated AM and PM Flex periods;
- Employees present professionally on screen when having Teams meetings;
- All Employees are issued with company supplied laptop, monitors and docking stations for home. Employees must accept full responsibility for using these in an honest, ethical, safe and legal manner;
- Employees must ensure that care is shown for the condition of their devices. If there is damage or loss, and the employee has not taken all reasonable care, the employee is responsible for the cost of repair or replacement.


## Guidelines

Team and Client meetings take priority over the flex timetable. Customer service and one team collaboration must remain the forefront of HH employees decision making;

Casual and Part time employees are expected to maintain the weekly contact hours specified in the Flex Schedule. Contact hours are $2 \times$ Short Days and $1 \times$ Full day in the office with your peers.

Where staff seek to go to part time hours, days worked must match the Flexible Work Schedule (Subject to Personnel Director discretion).

Because the nature of Flexible Work means that staff are not always able to see each other in person, there is an expectation that staff make themselves available for calls at the end of the day (as per Flex Schedule), to ensure a preparedness for the following day, check ins and follow ups to allow directors a window for contact.

AM and PM Flex is noted as some people prefer to work early or late. Where this is part of an employee's routine this needs to be noted in their outlook diary so that other team members can collaborate at different times.

The Flexible Work Policy is taken seriously and there is an expectation that employees respect the trust HH affords them when taking advantage of the policy. A breach of the flex work and/or equipment policy may result in disciplinary action.
