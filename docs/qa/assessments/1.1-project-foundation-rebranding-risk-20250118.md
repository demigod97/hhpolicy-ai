Date: 2025-01-18
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- **Total Risks Identified**: 5
- **Critical Risks**: 0
- **High Risks**: 2
- **Medium Risks**: 1
- **Low Risks**: 2
- **Risk Score**: 70/100 (Moderate Risk)

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. [TECH-001]: Database Migration Complexity

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Complex migration with table renames and FK updates
**Impact**: High - Complete application failure if migration fails
**Mitigation**:
- Create complete database backup before migration
- Test migration on staging environment first
- Implement migration rollback script with validation
- Add post-migration data integrity checks
**Testing Focus**: Database integration tests, FK relationship validation, rollback procedures

### 2. [TECH-002]: Legacy Code References

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Large codebase with extensive "notebook" terminology
**Impact**: Medium - Runtime errors and broken functionality
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive grep search for remaining "notebook" references
- TypeScript strict mode validation
- Runtime error monitoring implementation
- Post-deployment smoke test suite
**Testing Focus**: Full application smoke tests, TypeScript compilation validation

| TECH-002 | Technical   | Legacy code references         | 3    | 2      | 6     | Planned           |
| OPS-001  | Operational | Deployment rollback difficulty | 2    | 2      | 4     | Planned           |
| DATA-001 | Data        | Data loss during migration     | 1    | 3      | 3     | Accepted          |
| BUS-001  | Business    | User experience disruption    | 3    | 1      | 3     | Accepted          |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests (Must Have)

**Database Migration Tests**:
- Migration script validation on staging data
- FK constraint verification tests
- Data integrity checks post-migration
- Rollback procedure validation
- Performance impact assessment

**Code Reference Tests**:
- Automated search for legacy terminology
- TypeScript compilation validation
- Runtime error detection tests
- Full application smoke test suite
- Cross-browser compatibility tests

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests (Should Have)

**Deployment Tests**:
- Rollback procedure validation
- Feature flag functionality tests
- Environment-specific deployment tests

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests (Nice to Have)

**User Experience Tests**:
- User acceptance testing for terminology changes
- Help documentation validation
- Training material updates

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- **TECH-001**: Database backup and staging validation required
- **TECH-002**: Comprehensive terminology sweep and smoke tests required

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **OPS-001**: Rollback procedures documented and tested
- **DATA-001**: Database backups in place, monitoring configured

### Accepted Risks
- **BUS-001**: User terminology confusion - acceptable with proper documentation

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Database performance metrics after migration
- Application error rates and crash reports
- User support tickets related to terminology confusion
- Feature flag toggle success rates
- TypeScript compilation errors in CI/CD

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Migration script changes significantly
- Additional legacy code references discovered
- Database performance issues reported
- User feedback indicates confusion beyond expected levels
- Rollback procedures need to be executed

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Complete Database Backup Strategy** - Before any migration
2. **Staging Environment Testing** - Full migration validation
3. **Terminology Audit** - Automated search for remaining references

### Testing Priority Recommendations
1. Focus testing effort on database migration validation
2. Implement comprehensive smoke testing post-deployment
3. Set up monitoring for runtime errors and performance degradation

### Development Focus Areas
1. **Code Review Emphasis**: Focus on database schema changes and FK relationships
2. **Additional Validation**: TypeScript strict mode and compilation validation
3. **Documentation**: Clear rollback procedures and troubleshooting guides

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Phased Rollout**: Consider gradual user migration if possible
2. **Feature Flags**: Implement for major UI terminology changes
3. **Monitoring**: Enhanced error tracking and performance monitoring

## Gate Integration Recommendation

Based on risk analysis:
- **Recommended Gate Status**: CONCERNS
- **Rationale**: Two high-risk items require mitigation before production deployment
- **Blocking Items**: Database backup strategy and comprehensive testing validation
