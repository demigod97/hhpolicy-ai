- Risk Score: 35/100 (High Risk)

**ASSESSMENT: HIGH RISK - Multiple critical security and integration risks require immediate attention before deployment.**

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Cross-Role Data Leakage in Chat Responses

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High (3) - Complex multi-layer filtering with potential bypass points  
**Impact**: High (3) - Complete security model compromise, regulatory violations, executive data exposure  

**Root Cause**: Role-based filtering spans multiple system layers (frontend, N8N workflow, vector search, RLS) with potential failure points at each layer.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement defense-in-depth: Frontend role validation + N8N workflow filtering + Database RLS + Vector metadata filtering
- Add comprehensive audit logging for all chat queries and responses
- Implement response scanning to detect cross-role citations before delivery
- Create automated testing suite for role-leakage scenarios

**Testing Focus**: 
- Penetration testing with role manipulation attempts
- Comprehensive cross-role access prevention testing
- Edge case testing (session hijacking, token tampering, concurrent sessions)

### 2. SEC-002: N8N Workflow Authentication & Authorization Bypass

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Authentication mechanisms exist but complexity creates risk  
**Impact**: High (3) - Direct access to vector store without role filtering, complete data exposure  

**Root Cause**: N8N workflow relies on header authentication and user context passing, vulnerable to manipulation or bypass.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement JWT token validation in N8N workflow
- Add user role verification at workflow entry point
- Encrypt user context in API calls
- Implement workflow-level audit trails

**Testing Focus**:
- API endpoint security testing
- Token validation bypass attempts
- Direct workflow invocation testing

**Mitigation**:
- Implement atomic metadata updates with rollback capability
- Add metadata integrity checks in vector store operations
- Create comprehensive metadata validation tests

### 4. PERF-001: Vector Search Performance Degradation with Role Filtering

**Score: 6 (High)**
