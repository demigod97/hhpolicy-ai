## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Role Assignment Privilege Escalation
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Complex role logic prone to errors
**Impact**: High (3) - Could allow unauthorized document access across roles

**Description**: Incorrect implementation of role assignment could allow administrators to assign documents to roles they don't have authority over, or create conditions where documents become visible to wrong user groups.

**Affected Components**:
- Role assignment UI logic
- RLS policy enforcement for role_assignment field
- Document filtering in chat and dashboard interfaces

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement strict validation that administrators can only assign documents to 'administrator' and 'executive' roles
- Add server-side role validation in database functions
- Test all role assignment edge cases thoroughly
- Implement audit logging for role assignments

**Testing Requirements**:
- Test role assignment by different user types (admin, executive, super_admin)
- Verify cross-role document visibility prevention
- Test role assignment API endpoints with invalid role values
- Validate RLS policy enforcement after role changes

---

## High Risks Requiring Significant Attention

### 2. DATA-001: Document Visibility Inconsistency
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex filtering logic across multiple interfaces
**Impact**: High (3) - Documents visible to wrong role, compliance violations

**Description**: Role-based filtering must work consistently across dashboard, chat interface, and search functionality. Inconsistency could expose documents to unauthorized roles.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Centralize role-based filtering logic in shared service layer
- Add integration tests across all document access points
- Implement real-time UI updates when role assignments change
- Create comprehensive test scenarios for document visibility

### 3. TECH-001: RLS Policy Interaction Complexity
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Complex interaction between user-based and role-based policies
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Performance degradation or access control failures

**Description**: Existing RLS policies filter by user ownership. Adding role_assignment filtering creates complex policy interactions that could cause performance issues or logical conflicts.

**Affected Components**:
- policy_documents RLS policies
- Database query performance
- Document access patterns

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Review and optimize RLS policy combinations
- Add database query performance monitoring
- Test policy interaction scenarios thoroughly
- Consider policy consolidation for performance

---

## Medium Risks for Monitoring

### 4. BUS-001: Role Assignment UI Confusion
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - New UI patterns may confuse users
**Impact**: Medium (2) - User errors in document role assignment

**Description**: Administrators may accidentally assign documents to wrong roles, leading to documents being invisible to intended audience.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Add clear visual indicators for role assignments
- Implement confirmation dialogs for role changes
- Provide helpful tooltips explaining role implications
- Add undo functionality for recent role changes

### 5. PERF-001: Database Query Performance Impact
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Additional role_assignment filtering may slow queries
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Slower dashboard loading and chat responses

**Description**: Adding role_assignment field filtering to existing queries may impact performance, especially with large document sets.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Add database index on role_assignment field
- Monitor query performance with new filtering
- Optimize RLS policies for performance
- Consider query result caching

### 6. OPS-001: Role Assignment Audit Trail Gaps
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Audit requirements may not be fully addressed
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Compliance issues, difficulty troubleshooting role issues

**Description**: Changes to document role assignments should be audited for compliance and troubleshooting purposes.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement audit logging for role assignment changes
- Track who made changes and when
- Add role assignment history view
- Create reporting for role assignment activities

---

## Low Risks for Awareness

### 7. TECH-002: Default Role Assignment Logic
**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Default values may not be handled consistently
**Impact**: Low (1) - Minor inconvenience in role assignment workflow

**Description**: Default role assignment behavior may be inconsistent between upload and edit scenarios.

### 8. UX-001: Role Badge Visual Design
**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - UI design may not clearly indicate role assignments
**Impact**: Low (1) - Users may not immediately understand document role assignments

**Description**: Visual indicators for document role assignments may not be prominent enough.
