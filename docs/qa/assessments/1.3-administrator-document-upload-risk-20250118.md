- Add retry mechanisms for failed uploads
- Validate file completeness before processing

### 5. SEC-003: Storage Bucket Misconfiguration
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Common configuration error
**Impact**: High (3) - Unauthorized access to sensitive documents

**Description**: Incorrectly configured Supabase Storage policies could expose uploaded documents to unauthorized users.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement principle of least privilege for storage access
- Configure RLS policies for document isolation
- Regular security audits of storage permissions
- Use private buckets with explicit access controls

- Add performance monitoring

### 8. DATA-002: Metadata Loss Risk
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex upload flow
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Loss of document context and searchability

**Description**: File metadata (original name, upload date, user context) could be lost during the upload process.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Preserve original filename and metadata in database
- Add comprehensive audit logging
- Implement metadata validation and recovery
- Create backup procedures for metadata

### 9. BUS-001: Role-Based Access Enforcement
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Role system complexity
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Documents visible to wrong user groups

**Description**: Incorrect role assignment or enforcement could make documents visible to unauthorized user roles.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement strict role validation on upload
- Add role-based access controls to storage
- Create role assignment audit trails
- Regular access control reviews

## Low Risks for Awareness

### 10. TECH-001: Client-Side Validation Bypass
**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Easily bypassed
**Impact**: Low (1) - Server-side validation prevents impact

**Description**: Client-side file validation can be bypassed, but server-side validation provides protection.

### 11. OPS-002: Upload Progress Indication Issues
**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - UI complexity
**Impact**: Low (1) - User experience impact only

**Description**: Progress indicators might not work correctly, causing user confusion.

### 12. PERF-003: Concurrent Upload Limitations
**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Limited concurrent users initially
**Impact**: Medium (2) - System slowdown under high load

**Description**: System might not handle many concurrent uploads efficiently.
