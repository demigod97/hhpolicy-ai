Date: 2025-09-18
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- **Total Risks Identified**: 7
- **Critical Risks**: 1
- **High Risks**: 3
- **Risk Score**: 45/100 (High Risk - Requires Immediate Attention)

**ðŸ”´ CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT**: RLS Policy Bypass risk (SEC-001) requires mandatory resolution before production deployment.

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: RLS Policy Bypass

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Complex RLS policies are notoriously error-prone during initial implementation, especially with multi-role systems.
**Impact**: High - Could expose Administrator policy documents to Executive users or allow unauthorized data access across role boundaries, leading to compliance violations and data breaches.

**Mitigation**:
- **MANDATORY**: Implement comprehensive RLS test suite with test users for each role (Administrator, Executive, Super-Admin)
- Create automated RLS validation scripts that verify role separation in CI/CD pipeline
- Manual verification of role-based data access before any production deployment
- Add audit logging for all policy document access attempts
- Implement database-level triggers to log RLS policy evaluations

**Testing Focus**:
- Cross-role access attempts with different user sessions
- RLS policy effectiveness under concurrent user scenarios
- Edge cases: users with no roles, multiple roles, role changes

## High-Priority Risks

### 2. DATA-001: Migration Data Loss (Score: 6)
**Probability**: Medium - Schema changes from `notebooks` to `policy_documents` with foreign key updates carry inherent data loss risk
**Impact**: High - Loss of existing policy documents would be catastrophic for compliance system
**Mitigation**:
- Full database backup before migration execution
- Test migration on production data copy first
- Implement staged rollback procedures
- Verify data integrity post-migration with checksums

### 3. SEC-002: Privilege Escalation (Score: 6)
**Probability**: Medium - Role assignment mechanisms can contain logical flaws allowing unauthorized role elevation
**Impact**: High - Executive users gaining Administrator privileges could compromise entire policy system
**Mitigation**:
- Multi-factor role assignment verification
- Immutable audit trail for all role changes
- Separate super-admin approval workflow for role assignments
- Regular role assignment audits and reconciliation

### 4. TECH-001: Migration Rollback Failure (Score: 6)
**Probability**: Medium - Complex schema changes may not rollback cleanly if issues occur
**Impact**: High - Could result in stuck deployment state requiring manual database recovery
**Mitigation**:
- Test rollback procedures in staging environment
- Create step-by-step rollback documentation
- Implement database state checkpoints
- Prepare emergency recovery procedures

## Risk Distribution

### By Category
- **Security**: 2 risks (1 critical, 1 high)
- **Data**: 2 risks (2 high)
- **Technical**: 2 risks (1 high, 1 low)
- **Operational**: 1 risk (1 medium)

### By Component
- **Database Schema**: 4 risks (1 critical, 2 high)
- **RLS Policies**: 2 risks (1 critical, 1 medium)
- **Role Management**: 3 risks (2 high, 1 medium)
- **Migration Process**: 2 risks (1 high, 1 low)

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests (MUST COMPLETE)

**SEC-001 RLS Policy Testing**:
- Create test users with Administrator, Executive, and Super-Admin roles
- Verify each role can only access appropriate policy documents
- Test cross-role access attempts (should fail)
- Validate RLS policies under concurrent user sessions
- Test edge cases: users with no roles, expired roles, role changes

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests (REQUIRED)

**DATA-001 Migration Testing**:
- Test migration on production data copy
- Verify data integrity before/after with row counts and checksums
- Test rollback procedures
- Validate foreign key relationships post-migration

**SEC-002 Role Management Testing**:
- Test role assignment workflows
- Attempt unauthorized role escalation
- Verify audit trails for role changes
- Test role revocation scenarios

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests (RECOMMENDED)

- Standard foreign key constraint testing
- Deployment procedure validation
- Performance testing of role-based queries

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- **SEC-001**: RLS Policy Bypass (Critical) - Zero tolerance
- **DATA-001**: Migration Data Loss (High) - Must have verified rollback
- **SEC-002**: Privilege Escalation (High) - Must have role audit controls

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **OPS-001**: Production deployment issues - With staged deployment plan
- **DATA-002**: Role assignment corruption - With audit logging enabled

### Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Security**: RLS policy evaluation logs, failed access attempts
- **Data**: Role assignment changes, policy document access patterns
- **Technical**: Migration status, foreign key violations
- **Performance**: Role-based query performance, concurrent user handling

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- RLS policies are modified or extended
- New user roles are introduced
- Database schema changes are made
- Security incidents related to role-based access occur
- Performance issues with role-based queries emerge

## Gate Recommendation

**Based on risk analysis: FAIL**

**Rationale**: Critical security risk (SEC-001) with score 9 requires mandatory resolution. Multiple high-risk items (DATA-001, SEC-002, TECH-001) need comprehensive mitigation before production deployment.

**Required Actions Before PASS**:
1. Implement and validate comprehensive RLS test suite
2. Complete migration testing with verified rollback procedures
3. Implement role assignment audit controls
4. Document emergency recovery procedures

**Risk Score**: 45/100 (High Risk - Multiple critical/high risks identified)
