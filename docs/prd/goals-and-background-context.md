# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
The primary goals for the PolicyAi MVP are to:
* **Mitigate Compliance Risk:** Ensure all AI-generated answers are based exclusively on role-appropriate and up-to-date policy documents, providing verifiable citations for every response.
* **Improve Operational Efficiency:** Create a centralized, intelligent system that reduces the time Administrators spend on manual policy management and answering repetitive questions.
* **Empower Executive Decision-Making:** Provide a self-service tool for Executives to get instant, trustworthy answers to policy questions, reducing internal friction and delays.

## Background Context
PolicyAi addresses the significant operational inefficiencies and compliance risks organizations face when managing internal policies with generic tools like shared drives. Existing systems lack the specialized search, role-based access control, and intelligent oversight needed in a regulated environment. This PRD outlines the requirements for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that solves this problem by providing a secure, self-hosted platform with a purpose-built Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The initial focus is on delivering a robust solution for our two key user roles: Administrators and Executives.
