# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
The primary goals for the PolicyAi MVP are to:
* **Mitigate Compliance Risk:** Ensure all AI-generated answers are based exclusively on role-appropriate and up-to-date policy documents, providing verifiable citations for every response.
* **Improve Operational Efficiency:** Create a centralized, intelligent system that reduces the time Administrators spend on manual policy management and answering repetitive questions.
* **Empower Executive Decision-Making:** Provide a self-service tool for Executives to get instant, trustworthy answers to policy questions, reducing internal friction and delays.

## Background Context
PolicyAi addresses the significant operational inefficiencies and compliance risks organizations face when managing internal policies with generic tools like shared drives. Existing systems lack the specialized search, role-based access control, and intelligent oversight needed in a regulated environment. This PRD outlines the requirements for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that solves this problem by providing a secure, self-hosted platform with a purpose-built Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The initial focus is on delivering a robust solution for our two key user roles: Administrators and Executives.

## UI Transformation Update

### Chat-Focused Interface Implementation

Following the initial PRD requirements, the PolicyAi interface has been successfully transformed from a document-centric design to a chat-first experience. This transformation aligns with the core goal of providing a conversational interface for policy queries while maintaining the robust role-based access control and document management capabilities.

### Key Interface Changes Implemented

1. **Dashboard Transformation**: The main landing page now prioritizes chat creation and conversation management over document upload workflows
2. **Streamlined Navigation**: Users are guided directly to conversational interactions rather than administrative document management
3. **Simplified Card Interface**: Chat notebooks are displayed with clean, focused cards that emphasize conversation over complex role assignment UI
4. **Enhanced Chat Creation**: New dialog-based editors for creating and managing chat conversations with proper title and description management
5. **Background Administration**: Document upload and role management functionality maintained but moved to appropriate administrative contexts
6. **Improved User Experience**: The interface now reflects the conversational nature of policy queries as the primary use case

These changes fulfill the PRD vision of a "conversational query" paradigm while maintaining all functional requirements for role-based access and document management.
