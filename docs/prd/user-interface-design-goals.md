# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The UX vision for PolicyAi is clean, professional, and authoritative. It should feel like a serious, trustworthy tool for compliance and legal professionals. The interface must prioritize clarity, speed, and user confidence. Every interaction should reinforce that the user is getting the right information quickly and securely.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
* **Conversational Query:** The primary interaction for all users will be a chat-based interface for asking natural language questions.
* **Direct Manipulation:** For Administrators, a simple and clear document management interface (upload, assign role, view list) is required.
* **Minimalism:** The UI should avoid clutter, presenting only the necessary information and actions for the user's current task.

## Core Screens and Views
* **Sign-in Screen:** Secure user login.
* **Dashboard:** A chat-focused landing page with "Create New Chat" functionality and display of existing chat notebooks/conversations.
* **Chat Interface:** The main workspace, containing conversational policy query interface with source document integration and response citations.
* **Notebook Management:** Dialog-based editors for creating, editing, and managing chat notebooks with proper titles and descriptions.
* **User Management (Super-Admin):** Administrative interface for managing user roles (background functionality).

## Implemented Chat-First Design

### Core Interface Transformation
The interface has been successfully transformed to prioritize conversational interactions:

**Dashboard Experience:**
* **Empty State:** Users are welcomed with a chat-focused onboarding experience and prominent "Create New Chat" button
* **Notebook Grid:** Clean display of existing chat conversations without overwhelming administrative controls  
* **Simplified Cards:** Chat notebooks presented with streamlined design emphasizing conversation content

**Enhanced Chat Creation:**
* **Dialog-Based Editing:** Modal interfaces for creating and editing chat titles and descriptions
* **Seamless Integration:** Direct integration between chat creation and conversation flow
* **User Feedback:** Real-time feedback and validation during chat creation and management

**Administrative Balance:**
* **Background Operations:** Document upload and role management maintained but not primary interface focus
* **Context-Appropriate Access:** Administrative functions available when needed but don't dominate user experience

This implementation fulfills the "Conversational Query" paradigm identified as the primary interaction while maintaining the professional, trustworthy aesthetic outlined in the UX vision.

## Accessibility
* **WCAG AA**

## Branding
* The application will be rebranded to "PolicyAi". The UI should adopt a clean, corporate, and trustworthy aesthetic. A specific color palette and logo will need to be defined, but the overall tone should be professional and muted.

## Target Device and Platforms
* **Web Responsive** (Desktop and Mobile browsers)
