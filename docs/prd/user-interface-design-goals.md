# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The UX vision for PolicyAi is clean, professional, and authoritative. It should feel like a serious, trustworthy tool for compliance and legal professionals. The interface must prioritize clarity, speed, and user confidence. Every interaction should reinforce that the user is getting the right information quickly and securely.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
* **Conversational Query:** The primary interaction for all users will be a chat-based interface for asking natural language questions.
* **Direct Manipulation:** For Administrators, a simple and clear document management interface (upload, assign role, view list) is required.
* **Minimalism:** The UI should avoid clutter, presenting only the necessary information and actions for the user's current task.

## Core Screens and Views
* **Sign-in Screen:** Secure user login.
* **Dashboard:** A view listing all "Policy Documents" accessible to the logged-in user.
* **Policy Document View:** The main workspace, containing the source list, the chat/query interface, and the "Saved Policies" (formerly notes) area.
* **User Management (Super-Admin):** A simple interface for the super-admin to manage user roles.

## Accessibility
* **WCAG AA**

## Branding
* The application will be rebranded to "PolicyAi". The UI should adopt a clean, corporate, and trustworthy aesthetic. A specific color palette and logo will need to be defined, but the overall tone should be professional and muted.

## Target Device and Platforms
* **Web Responsive** (Desktop and Mobile browsers)
