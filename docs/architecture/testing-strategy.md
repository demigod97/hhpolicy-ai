# Testing Strategy

A comprehensive, three-layered testing strategy will be implemented:

1.  **Foundational Testing Pyramid:** For all deterministic code.
2.  **Real-Time E2E and AI Behavior Testing:** Using Playwright and AG-UI to test the AI's reasoning process.
3.  **AI Quality Evaluation:** Using a "golden dataset" derived from the sample policy documents to test for regressions.
