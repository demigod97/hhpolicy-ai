### Next Steps: Development Phase

#### Immediate Priority: Story 1.1 (HHR-78)
**Status**: Ready to start
**Tasks**: HHR-93, HHR-94, HHR-95
**Estimated Time**: 9-13 hours
**Dependencies**: None (foundation story)

#### Development Sequence
1. **HHR-78**: Project Foundation & Rebranding (Critical)
2. **HHR-79**: Initial Database Schema & Role Setup (High)
3. **HHR-80**: Administrator Document Upload (High)
4. **HHR-81**: Basic RAG Ingestion (High)
5. **HHR-82**: Role-Aware Chat for Administrators (High)
6. **HHR-83**: Administrator Assignment of Executive Policies (Medium)
7. **HHR-84**: Executive Document Access & Chat (Medium)
8. **HHR-85**: Advanced RAG - Date Metadata Extraction (Medium)
9. **HHR-86**: Outdated Policy Flagging (Medium)

## Resource Requirements

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React with Vite, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)
- **Workflow**: N8N for RAG pipeline processing
- **Deployment**: Self-hostable (Vercel/Netlify for frontend)

### Key Dependencies
- Supabase project setup and configuration
- N8N instance for workflow automation
- LLM provider (OpenAI, Gemini) for RAG pipeline
- Policy documents in docs/HH Data/ for testing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **N8N Workflow Complexity**: RAG pipeline development may take longer than estimated
- **Role-Based Security**: RLS policies and access control require careful implementation
- **Document Processing**: Text extraction and vector storage reliability

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with simple workflows and iterate
- Implement comprehensive testing for security features
- Use existing policy documents for testing and validation
